# Hyperledger Fabric Event Extraction

This project is developed during my master thesis at the Institute [AIFB](http://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/Hauptseite) of the [KIT](http://www.kit.edu).

## What id does

This project allows to extract meaningful event data from a running Hyperledger Fabric or Hyperledger Composer instance and save these events in process-log like structure to apply [process mining techniques](https://www.win.tue.nl/ieeetfpm/downloads/Process%20Mining%20Manifesto.pdf).
